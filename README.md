<h1 align="center">packem-lodash-test</h1>

This is just a simple _Getting started_ sample project for the Packem bundler that I've written to demonstrate its performance.

## Quick Start

Simple clone this repo and install its dependencies as shown below.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bukharim96/packem-lodash-test.git
cd packem-lodash-test
npm install
```

Next, make sure to have `packem` installed globally.

```bash
npm install packem -g
```

You may also use Yarn instead of npm.

Lastly, run `packem` or `packem --verbose` (for more info) in the repo in order to witness it bundle `~427` modules in less than `5 seconds`.

Fiddle with it as much as you want, and please do feel free to submit any issues to [Packem's repo](https://github.com/packem/packem).
